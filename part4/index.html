                <p>As a new media artist it is important to know how to self publish your work online. In order to do this, learning how to use git commands to publish to github is a very valuable skill.</p>

                <p>On Mac:</p>
                <p>Most versions of MacOS will already have <code>Git</code> installed and you can activate it in the terminal with <code>git version</code>. However, if you don't have Git installed for whatever reason, you can install the latest version of Git using one of several popular methods.</p>
                <ol>
                    <p><em>Install git from an Installer</em></p>
                    <li>Navigate to the latest <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/git-2.23.0-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg/download?use_mirror=autoselect">macOS Git Installer </a>and download the latest version.</li>
                    <li>Open the command prompt "terminal" and type <code>git version</code> to verify Git was installed.</li>
                    <p><em>Install git from Homebrew</em></p>
                    <li>Install <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> if you don't already have it, then:
                    <code>$ brew install git</code></li>
                    <li>Once the command output has completed, you can verify the installation by typing: <code>git version.</code></li>
                </ol>

        <div class="slide-item">
            <div class="slide-content" style="font-size: .75em;" id="github">
                <p>Github is a versioning tool where you can save and update your code. Every time you save your code, it is called a commit. A commit means a saved version of your code at a particular point. You can always restore you repository to a specific commit since each one has its own id and timestamp. You can do this a few different ways, but I am gonna show you how via the terminal.</p>
                <p>Go to github and click on the top left corner icon > Your repositories</p>
                <p>A repositories is essentially a folder and once you make a repository on GitHub, you are able to connect it to your local directory using a command called <code>git clone</code>.</p>
                <p>Once you make your repository, there area a few settings.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep it publish. you will need to in order to publish the site via Github Pages.</li>
                    <li>You may add a README file, its just a text file where you an write about your repository to folks.</li>
                    <li>Keep everything else the same. You can choose a license if you want. If you want to, MIT License is common, but its not really a big deal if you keep it none for small personal art sites.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="slide-content">
              <p>First we are going to set up our project on github by creating a new repository.</p>
              <p>Select "New"</p>
              <p>Name your repository</p>
              <p>Leave all the other settings and select "Create Repository"</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide-item">
            <div class="slide-content">
                <p>Now that you have made a repository, click on it and click on the green button that says "Code".</p>
                <p>Simply just copy the URL and open your terminal.</p>
                <p>Type <code>git clone url</code></p>
                <p>the folder should show up in your home folder</p>
                <p><code>cd foldername</code> to navigate to the folder locally to start creating files.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide-item">
            <div class="slide-content" style="font-size: .75em;">
                <p>When you are ready, you can drop your files inside your site folder into this folder that is connected to GitHub.</p>
                
                <p>Once you place your files inside the folder, make sure you are inside the correct folder. You can look at the file path above where you type commands, or type <code>ls</code> to view all files to see that it looks like your folder. Then type <code>git status</code>.</p>
                <p>Tt should appear like a list of red files. This means that you have "unstaged" files ready to be added the the "staging area". To add all unstaged files type <code>git add .</code>.</p>
                <p>To see this change, type <code>git status</code> again. You should see all the files turn green. Which means that the files are now "staged" and ready to be commit.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide-item">
            <div class="slide-content">
                <p>Now you are ready to commit your files. Which means you are stating the changes that you made to your files. You will have a message denoting the changes. You can essentially write anything as a message. Type <code>git commit -m "write your message here"</code></p>
                <p>You can type <code>git status again to see the message that your commit was made.</code></p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide-item">
            <div class="slide-content">
                <p>Now you can take your commit and push it to github. Making it available on the internet! Type <code>git push -u origin main</code> or just <code>git push</code>.</p>
                <p>You should see a bunch of messages cascade in your terminal and you will know that everything worked if you see a message with 100% in it. Or you can go to your GitHub repository webpage and see the files added.</p>

              <p>Once you start to make your websites, you want to be able to make the layouts look good on both mobile and desktop. For this, we use media queries.</p>
              <p>Media queries is a piece of code that specifies what CSS styles are at a certain screen width. Usually we think of mobile devices as screens less than 600px. </p>

              <p>In our CSS we can use:</p>
              <pre><code>@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
body {
        background-color: lightblue;
     }
}</code></pre>
